# Project_1MD
This was the first-ever Unreal Engine 4 game I began work on back in 2017. This was before my time in university, so GitHub wasn't known to me. I developed this in my free time using blueprints only due to my lack of knowledge of C++. It involved basic AI, melee system, lighting, sound design, player movement, map design, menus, animations, basic cutscene work, particle systems, and many actor blueprints for common survival horror items. This was all self-taught, so the resulting code is subpar in optimisation and implementation and if I were to continue development, I'd create a new project from the ground up using C++ as a base while ensuring correct use of interfaces and other common professional programming techniques rather than what was achieved here. Regardless, I'm proud this is a show of interest, self-motivation, and curiosity for game development and the games industry.
