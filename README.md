# Project_1MD
This was the first ever unreal engine game I began work on back in 2017. This was prior to my time in university so Github wasn't known to me. I developed this in my free time using blueprints only due to my lack of knowledge of C++. It involved basic AI, melee systems, lighting, sound design, player movement, map creating, menus, animations, etc
